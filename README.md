It is a clone of [2048 5x5](https://github.com/bahmutov/2048)
with an occasional popup question to let you cram JavaScript topics.
If you answer the question correctly - the pieces move, otherwise
they stay put, plus new tiles appear. Basically you lose a turn AND
get a penalty tile by answering incorrectly.

The questions can have zero, one, several or all correct answers.

You can learn answers by reading these books:
